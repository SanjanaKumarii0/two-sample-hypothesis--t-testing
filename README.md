# Two-Sample Hypothesis-t-Testing (T-Test) in Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **two-sample hypothesis testing** using Python.  
The goal is to check whether the means of two independent groups are statistically different, which is a common test in statistics and data analysis.

## 📊 Concepts Used
- Hypothesis Testing
- Null and Alternative Hypothesis
- Two-Sample T-Test
- P-value interpretation
- Statistical decision making

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 📂 File Description
- ` Two-Sample Hypothesis-t-Testing (T-Test).ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the dataset loading, exploratory analysis, and performing two-sample t-test with interpretation.
